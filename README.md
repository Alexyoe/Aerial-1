# Aerial - Apple TV Screen Saver for Windows
 
Aerial is a Windows screen saver that mimics the Apple TV screen saver that displays the videos Apple shot over New York, San Francisco, Hawaii, China, etc. as well as from the ISS and various underwater locations.

Aerial is inspired by [Mac Aerial Screen Saver](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial) and [Aerial for Windows](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial).

## About
This is a [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)/[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) based implementation of [Mac Aerial Screen Saver](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial) for Windows. I was using cDima's [Aerial for Windows](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial) on my computer but wished it had more of the features found in the MacOS version, as well as being less buggy and having better 4K support. Not knowing much about C# and with the project seemingly dead I researched Windows screensavers and found I could make a screen saver with Node.JS and Electron â€“ both of which I am very familiar with. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be able build on this implementation and it get it to near where the MacOS version is.
